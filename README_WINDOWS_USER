The models Planet Simulator, PUMA and the postprocessor Pumaburner
can be compiled and run with Windows if you have a FORTRAN-90
and a C++ compiler installed (e.g. GNU FORTRAN and GNU C++).

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) and MoSt (Model Starter)
are written using the Xlib (X11) library and cannot run 
with native Windows.

There are following solutions:

1) Install a X11 emulator (e.g. the free Cygwin X11).
   I've heard from users, that they got it to work with the models.

2) Install a Linux in a virtual machine like "Parallels" or "VMware".
   Then use the virtual machine for running the models.

3) Install Linux (e.g. OpenSUSE 11.2) on your Windows-Computer.
   It can coexist with Windows and installs a boot manager, that
   enables switching between Linux and Windows at boot time.

Solution 3 is the cheapest (for free) and fastest solution.

Please don't ask Windows related questions via email,
we don't support Windows!

But you may open a thread on our forum
http://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/Forum.5807.0.html
if you want to discuss with other Windows users.

If there is a skilled Windows-programmer, who successfully programs
a Windows-GUI for our models, I'll include that version in
fortcoming releases too.
