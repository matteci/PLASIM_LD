=======================================================================
Requirements:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following software components are necessary for running the models:

1. C          compiler (cc, gcc, sunfc)
2. C++        compiler (c++, g++)
3. FORTRAN-90 compiler (gfortran, g95, f90, sunf90)
4. make       utility  (make, gmake)
5. X11        include  (/usr/X11/include, /usr/X11R6/include)
6. X11        library  (/usr/X11/lib64    /usr/X11/lib)
=======================================================================
Optional for multi-processor (parallel) program execution:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
mpi           message passing interface (mpich, openMPI)
mpif90        compiler
mpicc         compiler
mpirun        execution script
=======================================================================
The configure script tries to locate all necessary components.
If something is missing, you have to install these packages.
Most Linux distributions have these packages on board and all you
have to do is, to mark these for installation in the software manager.
All required software is available in free open source packages.
=======================================================================
1. Open a terminal window and enter the most directory.
2. Run "./configure.sh" in this directory
3. Type "most.x" or "./most.x" to run the "Model Starter".
4. Choose model "PUMA" or "Planet Simulator" with a mouse click.
5. Click on the button "Save & Run" for model building and execution.
6. For using more than 1 core you must have MPI (Message Passing Interface).
7. Standard resolutions are: T21 (64x32 grid), T31 (96x48), and T42 (128x64).
8. Per aspera ad astra
