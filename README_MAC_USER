This version was successfully tested on MAC's running
MAC-OS X 10.5 Leopard and MAC-OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
It was necessary to install the FORTRAN-90 compiler "gfortran".

Hint: Install the utility "port" (http://www.macports.org).

Then you may use port to install more usefull software, like:

sudo port install gcc45 +gfortran   (newest compiler suite)
sudo port install cdo               (climate data operators)
sudo port install grads2            (graphics software)
sudo port install ImageMagick       (graphics software)
sudo port install gv                (Postscript viewer)
sudo port install openmpi           (Parallelization package)

Good luck,

Edilbert
